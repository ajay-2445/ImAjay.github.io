        <p>Hi, I’m <strong>Ajay Kumar Kahar</strong>, a BTech student in Computer Science & Technology, currently in my <strong>second year</strong> at <strong>Shivaji University, Department of Technology, Kolhapur, Maharashtra</strong>. My journey has been full of excitement, learning, and adaptation. I come from <strong>Nepal</strong>, and moving to a new environment in Kolhapur for my studies was both thrilling and challenging.</p>

        <p>I was fortunate to receive the <strong>ICCR scholarship</strong>, which gave me the opportunity to pursue my dreams of studying in India. Adjusting to a new city, culture, and academic environment was not easy, but it pushed me to grow, become independent, and embrace new experiences. From the first day, I focused on building a strong foundation in programming, computer fundamentals, and technology.</p>

        <p>During my first year, I started exploring <strong>web development and frontend projects</strong>, including my <strong>personal portfolio website</strong>, where I could showcase my skills and projects. Each small project taught me important lessons in coding, design, and problem-solving. Beyond academics, I actively participate in extracurricular activities like <strong>volleyball</strong>, where I have achieved success, winning the <strong>first prize</strong>, which taught me teamwork, discipline, and perseverance.</p>

        <p>Being in a new city and university also helped me develop life skills—time management, self-learning, and adapting to a different environment. I am now looking forward to learning more advanced programming concepts, taking on bigger projects, and sharing my journey through my blog. Every project completed, every challenge faced, and every lesson learned is a step forward in my journey as a developer and as a person.</p>
